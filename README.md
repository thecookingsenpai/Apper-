# Appero

## The easiest way to create a native application from any website

### Installation and usage

Download the release and double click on Appero! or:

    git clone https://github.com/thecookingsenpai/appero && cd appero
    ./Appero!


At the first launch Appero might have to download and install node.js, brew and the required packages. This will happens only once.

Once finished, the application will be available in the appero/apps folder.
